                  Hello my name is Breana Laray Williams and when grow up I want to be a Interior/fashion designer,photographer and an athlete, If that is you then the college for you is <a herf="http://fidm.edu/en/visit+fidm">FIDM</a>. It is short for Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising. My plans for achieveing the goal of a major in Fashion Design and Photography is to join the fashion clubs at school and take same or a different fashion class at school. Over the summer and throughout the year attend the <a herf="http://fidm.edu/en/Calendar/Workshops/#tab_pane2">Events and Workshops</a> that the college offers. This is what I want to be when I grow up because I like to make/modify things in the clothing and interior and exterior category and take pictures on of what I design and the world around me. Also when I grow up I want to be a athlete. I have now been running track for over 10 year now. The events that I participated in are <a herf="https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=Gwen+Female+Hammer+Thrower&&view=detail&mid=B1D074FAD5C73109D4C0B1D074FAD5C73109D4C0&rvsmid=2A8E1964364A6DF9F8382A8E1964364A6DF9F838&FORM=VDQVAP">Hammer Throw</a>,<a herf="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLRCZo6i8bk">Discus</a>,<a herf="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y463P-Y4o18"> Shot Put</a> and the <a herf="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFfudAXH4rc">Javelin</a>, so you can say that I am thrower and since I have a lot of experience technique and strength, you could say that I am pretty good at it.

                <p style="text-align:center;">
                  Some Characteristics that relate to this career is patience and to be open-minded. Some ways that I have shown patience, was in my Fashion and Interior Design class and in that class I was asked to do a number of <a herf="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/4f/10/0d/4f100d712883b6ca1ab7d0871d990d90--sewing-basics-sewing-tips.jpg">Hand Stitching</a> and I would keep getting it wrong so I would have to take it out and redo it until I did it right. A time when I had to be open minded is when deciding whether I wanted to do something simple and elegant or something fashionable and complex and I chose the fashionable and complex so that I can challenge my self and explore what I can do. Also some more characters that relate to this career is teamwork and communication. This took place at a track practice in 2017, all the throwers were assigned the same work, so instead of going it alone I asked everyone to do it together so that we all came get it done at the same time and all together. The other one was at a track meet  and each events starts at the a certain time so when I get the information  I make sure that everyone knows so that they won't miss their event and be disqualified (DQ)

                  What I accomplished in  the fashion class was a living room made out of  a shoe box, neon orange spray paint, chandelier earrings, some leaves for my old little mis pet shop collection and some small posters for out of a magazine. My next accomplishment in that class was creating to create a Ideal building and it all have to edible, so my group and I decide to create a Modern-day <a herf="scr= Images/house.jpg">Beach House</a> (gingerbread house style) made out of cookies, white icing, pretzels for the umbrella and chairs, and  sugar with cookie crumbs to make the sand and also some Kit Kats for the black wood that was on top of the house. That is some achievements/accomplishmentomplishments for more, and if you would like to see more just click <a herf="https://preview.c9users.io/breanawilliams/cse5-williams-b/HTML_Project/Williams_Projects.html">Breana's Projects</a> to see more. First job was when I was 14 and I worked at a daycare and at the daycare I would help the my manager with the kids. The things that I would help her with is prepare the food, set up games and help the kids with their reading and writing. The best part of the job  would be spending time with the kids, and getting to know them and watching them grow to become great people in the world. Also another thing that I liked was going on the field trips with the kids and having fun with them. What I learned from this experience is that I like to have fun and do work and also that I enjoy working with other people. In conclusion I am Breana Williams and I am 15 years old and I am a sophomore at Dublin High School  and I want to go to FIDM to study fashion and interior design and photography.
